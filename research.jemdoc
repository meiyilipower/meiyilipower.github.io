- Proposed a dual-adaptivity inertia control strategy for the IIDG based on the virtual synchronous generator to 
: {1)offer responsive and stable frequency support.}
: {2)achieve the balance between power regulation and frequency regulation according to different operating conditions.}
- Derived transfer functions of the IIDG power and angular frequency.
- Analyzed the response characteristics (overshoot and resettling time) of the IIDG output power and frequency.
- Proposed an assessment method considering the cumulative effect of the output deviation and its duration to 
: {1)cope with the tradeoff between speed and tracking accuracy.}
: {2)universally reflect the dynamic performance of power and frequency.}
